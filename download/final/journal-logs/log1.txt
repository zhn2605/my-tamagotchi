Journal Logs - Day 1

Shitty weather. Got my new coat dirty as well. Besides that, I would say my first day went better than I thought. Way to go me! (Is that corny to write to myself). My first day as a Tamagotchi-sitter, I've never seen any cat so cute. I know his name is Tubbs but I think a nick name suits him better... maybe Loki! Yea, that feels right. Have to think about getting food for it tomorrow though, wonder what I should bring him. Owner did say not to feed him too much... oh well. Six more days!
